            <h2>Study of the Domain</h2>
            <h3 id="idea">Idea</h3>
            <p>Legendary creatures have been a vital part of human culture and imagination, embodying humanity's deepest fears, hopes, and mysteries. From ancient myths to modern narratives, these mythical beings transcend their origins, becoming cultural symbols that reveal the beliefs, values, and artistic expressions of the societies that created them. The allure of legendary creatures lies in their ability to blur the line between the known and the unknown, the real and the fantastical, offering both cautionary tales and sources of wonder.</p>
            <p>These creatures are not confined to any one medium or period; they evolve alongside human creativity, appearing in literature, visual art, music, and interactive media. Each iteration reflects the cultural context of its time, revealing insights into the society that embraced it. For instance, dragons, which appear in legends across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, have been portrayed variously as symbols of power, greed, wisdom, or chaos, depending on the cultural framework. Similarly, the vampire has transitioned from folklore's grotesque revenant to literature's romantic antihero, illustrating how legendary creatures adapt to changing societal narratives.</p>
            <p>Our project focuses on the enduring fascination with these mythical beings by exploring their representation in a variety of forms and contexts. The chosen domain spans both historical and contemporary interpretations, showcasing how legendary creatures function as enduring cultural artifacts. From Renaissance art to modern video games, and from ancient Japanese prints to 20th-century cinema, these representations highlight the versatility of legendary creatures in reflecting human creativity and cultural shifts.</p>
            <p>The items selected for this project were chosen to provide a comprehensive view of the domain, illustrating its richness and diversity. Each item not only depicts a legendary creature but also offers a unique perspective on the cultural, historical, and artistic significance of these beings. By studying these items, we aim to uncover the deeper meanings behind the representations of legendary creatures and understand how they contribute to cultural identity and knowledge transmission.</p>
            <p>This investigation is particularly relevant in the context of digital humanities, where the convergence of traditional scholarship and digital tools enables us to analyze and reinterpret cultural phenomena. Through this project, we aspire to demonstrate the role of legendary creatures in shaping and reflecting human culture, offering insights that bridge past and present, myth and reality.</p>
            <h3 id="items">Items</h3>
            <p>Legendary creatures have served as symbols of human creativity and collective imagination, transcending geographical boundaries and historical epochs. To explore their cultural significance, we selected ten diverse items that span different media, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Together, these items illustrate the multifaceted representation and interpretation of legendary creatures.</p>
            <h4>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h4>
            <p>One cornerstone of our study is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a critically acclaimed video game that draws heavily from Slavic folklore. The game's meticulously crafted world features a plethora of legendary creatures, such as leshys, strigas, and noonwraiths, all of which play pivotal roles in its narrative and gameplay. These beings are not only adversaries or allies but also symbols of the cultural myths and ecological themes the game seeks to evoke.</p>
            <h4>The Bomarzo Gardens</h4>
            <p>The Bomarzo Gardens in Italy, also known as the Sacred Wood of Bomarzo, present a unique physical representation of legendary creatures. Designed in the 16th century by Pier Francesco Orsini, the gardens are populated with monumental sculptures of mythical beings such as dragons, sirens, and giants. These sculptures, carved into the natural landscape, embody a Renaissance fascination with allegory and the grotesque, blending mythological themes with the patron's personal grief and philosophical musings.</p>
            <h4>Kraken-Migof</h4>
            <p>In the realm of modern art, Bernard Schultze's sculpture Kraken-Migof offers a surreal interpretation of the legendary sea monster. Schultze's abstract and textural approach creates a fluid, almost organic representation of the Kraken, emphasizing the creature's alien and transformative nature. This artwork provides a modern, imaginative lens through which the mythical can be understood in the context of existential and artistic exploration.</p>
            <h4>Monstrorum Historia</h4>
            <p>Ulisse Aldrovandi's Monstrorum Historia, originally written in the 16th century and translated into contemporary Italian, represents an early attempt to document the mythical and natural worlds. This compendium blends scientific observation with vivid descriptions of legendary creatures, reflecting the Renaissance endeavor to reconcile myth and reality. It serves as both a historical artifact and a resource that underscores the interplay between folklore and early scientific inquiry.</p>
            <h4>San Giorgio e il drago</h4>
            <p>Paolo Uccello's painting San Giorgio e il drago exemplifies the artistic traditions of the Italian Renaissance. The depiction of Saint George slaying the dragon is both a religious allegory of good triumphing over evil and a dramatic visual representation of a popular legend. Uccello's distinctive use of perspective and color enhances the narrative power of the scene, offering insight into how legendary creatures were woven into moral and spiritual narratives.</p>
            <h4>Hereford Mappa Mundi</h4>
            <p>The Hereford Mappa Mundi, a medieval map created around 1300, integrates geographical knowledge with representations of mythical and legendary creatures. Depictions of beings like cynocephali and dragons populate its margins, serving as symbolic markers of the unknown and reflecting medieval European perceptions of the world. The map is a testament to how legendary creatures were used to convey cosmological and theological ideas.</p>
            <h4>Cryptid</h4>
            <p>The board game Cryptid brings legendary creatures into the realm of modern entertainment. Players engage in a strategic search for a hidden mythical creature, combining logic, deduction, and storytelling. This interactive experience demonstrates how legendary creatures continue to inspire collective imagination and are adapted into contemporary formats that emphasize community and discovery.</p>
            <h4>The Firebird</h4>
            <p>Stravinsky's opera The Firebird offers a musical reinterpretation of Slavic folklore. The titular Firebird, a symbol of power and transformation, is central to the opera's narrative and thematic resonance. Through Stravinsky's innovative composition, the legendary creature becomes a dynamic character that bridges traditional folklore and modernist music.</p>
            <h4>Kuwana: the Story of the Sailor Tokuzo</h4>
            <p>the Japanese woodblock print Kuwana: The Story of the Sailor Tokuzo illustrates a tale of the supernatural at sea. The print combines vivid imagery and storytelling, highlighting a legendary creature from Japanese folklore. This work exemplifies the Edo-period tradition of using art to preserve and propagate cultural myths and legends.</p>

            <h2>Knowledge Organization</h2>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
            <h3 id="conceptual-map">Conceptual Map</h3>
            <p>Firstly, we modeled the scenario by creating a conceptual map. This involved selecting the data associated with the various items we identified and defining the relationships between them. To ensure clarity, we expressed these relationships using natural language.</p>
            <h3 id="er-model">E/R Model</h3>
            <p>Next, we developed a more abstract model, focusing on the entities that form the foundation of the scenario. This step allowed us to highlight the core components and their roles within the conceptual framework.</p>
            <h3 id="metadata-analysis">Metadata Analysis</h3>
            <p>The next step involved identifying the metadata standards used by institutions to describe the chosen items. When it was unclear which metadata standard had been applied to a specific item, we selected the one that best fit its description.</p>
            <h3 id="metadata-alignment">Metadata Alignment</h3>
            <p>Then, for each concept described in natural language, we identified the most suitable entities or relationships within the metadata standards previously analyzed.</p>
            <h3 id="theoretical-model">Theoretical Model</h3>
            <p>At this stage, we sought additional potential connections to enhance the initial model. This involved researching more information about agents, places, and dates associated with the main items and integrating these new data points into the model. 
                We used various colors to highlight to which set of concepts each entity belongs to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>what: red</li>
                <li>who: blue</li>
                <li>where: green</li>
                <li>when: yellow</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Additionally, we opted to reshape some item entities using the FRBR conceptual model for a more structured representation.</p>
            <h3 id="er-model-enhanced">E/R Model enhanced</h3>
            <p>Consequently, we incorporated the new information into the E/R model as well.</p>
            <h3 id="conceptual-model">Conceptual Model</h3>
                <p>
                  The final step of the knowledge organization phase involved creating a conceptual model using an ontological approach. To achieve this, we refactored the terms from the theoretical model by aligning them with terms from existing schemas, vocabularies, and ontologies. Specifically, we reused the following:
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Among the various options for formalizing the FRBR conceptual model, we chose <strong>LRMoo</strong> due to its full compatibility with CIDOC CRM. This decision ensured consistency with our overarching ontological framework. Additionally, we used <code>owl:sameAs</code> to link entities to their corresponding VIAF entries and to establish equivalences between classes in different ontologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To further enrich our model, we identified semantic associations between entities or classes, employing various SKOS properties. Specifically:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>skos:broadMatch</strong>: Used to link a class from a specific ontology to one from another ontology that represents a broader concept 
                    (e.g., the class <em>Legendary Creatures</em> is broadly matched with the CIDOC class <em>E28 Conceptual Object</em>).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>skos:narrowMatch</strong>: Used to link a class from a specific ontology to one from another ontology that represents a narrower concept 
                    (e.g., the <em>schema</em> class <em>Organization</em> is narrowly matched with the CIDOC class <em>E39 Actor</em>).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>skos:related</strong>: Used to link two entities that are connected in some way, without indicating a hierarchical relationship 
                    (e.g., the occupation <em>Composer</em> is related to the occupation <em>Conductor</em>, which is also related to the occupation <em>Pianist</em>).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These steps allowed us to formalize and enrich our conceptual model, ensuring it was both robust and interoperable across various ontological frameworks.
